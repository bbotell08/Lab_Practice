                <p>
                    People will learn and drive at Willows Springs International Speedway. This track takes you in the desert in a super-fast 2.5-mile / nine-turn road racing circuit, 
                    patterned after the great courses and road racing traditions of Europe, and is unchanged from its original 1953 configuration.

                <h3>Is it safe to enroll F1 Driving Experience under safety considerations?</h3>

                <img src="imgs/f1_safety25.png" alt="safety icon">

                <p>
                    We recommend always driving on a dry day rather than on a wet day, to the risks of drivers who are not experienced driving in the rain. 
                    If rain conditions are harsher on a day you are scheduled for the F1 Driving Experience, it may be rescheduled.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are also ambulances and a hospital center nearby on the track if a driver does get injured or feels sick under certain conditions of g-force levels.Â
